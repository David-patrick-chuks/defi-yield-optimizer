## üîÆ Future Roadmap

Based on user feedback and market research, we've identified several key areas for future improvement:

### Key Learnings & Improvement Areas

- **Enhanced Risk Modeling**: Incorporate more sophisticated risk models that can better predict market volatility and protocol vulnerabilities
- **User Experience Optimization**: Simplify the dashboard interface based on user feedback to make risk metrics more accessible to crypto newcomers
- **Performance Improvements**: Optimize wallet connection and token data loading to reduce wait times during analysis

### Planned Features

1. **Multi-Chain Support**: Expand beyond Ethereum to analyze assets across Solana, Polygon, Avalanche, and other major blockchains
2. **Portfolio Simulation**: Allow users to test hypothetical portfolio changes and see how they would affect overall risk metrics
3. **Risk Alerts**: Implement a notification system to alert users about significant changes in risk profiles of tokens they hold
4. **Mobile Application**: Develop native mobile apps for iOS and Android to enable on-the-go risk analysis
5. **API Access**: Create a developer API allowing third-party integration of our risk analysis engine
6. **Advanced AI Reports**: Enhance the AI analysis with more detailed recommendations and educational content about specific risks

### Community Engagement

- Launch a governance token to allow community participation in platform development decisions
- Create an educational hub with resources about DeFi risk management
- Establish partnerships with major DeFi protocols for deeper integration and analysis
